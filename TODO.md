# Create different environments and load them with provess.env
# First release will be in english - move strings to one file
# Bug: Sorted list does not update when new item is added
# Add duration to sorting
# Make sorting scrollable horizontally or move to it's own menu
# Implement patching of task metrics (add, change or remove metrics)
# Test navigation (e.g. SignIn should not redirect to SignUp)
# Lock createTask or patchTask until image is uploaded
# Scale image before uploading
# Use loading indicator
